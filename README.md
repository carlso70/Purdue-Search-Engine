# Purdue-Search-Engine
Advanced Java Programming project CS390. crawls the purdue.edu related urls, and then adds them to a mysql dbs. There is a table of urls with a urlid attached to them. Then there is a db of words which is a table of all the words throughout the urls. Each world has a urlid attached to it. When searching for a word through the search engine, the program looks for urls that have the most common occurence of a word and fetch it in order of most importance to least importance. 

NOTE this project is focused on the styling, and CSS but rather web crawling, and database work.
